        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        Studying galactic mean-field dynamos is motivated by a desire to understand the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies, including our own Milky Way. These magnetic fields play crucial roles in various astrophysical processes, influencing the dynamics of interstellar gas, the formation and evolution of stars, and even the propagation of cosmic rays.
        Magnetic fields are believed to have implications for cosmology, potentially affecting the large-scale structure of the universe and influencing processes such as galaxy clustering and the formation of cosmic filaments. By studying galactic mean-field dynamos, scientists aim to understand how magnetic fields contribute to the broader cosmological framework.
        Thus studying galactic mean-field dynamos is motivated by the desire to understand the fundamental role that magnetic fields play in shaping the dynamics and evolution of galaxies, as well as their broader implications for astrophysics and cosmology.<br>
        In this website, I am going to look at the difference between &#945;-&#937; Dynamo and &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo.Trying to find out the different aspect that influences the working of the Dynamo and try calculate the Critical values of these which control the dynamo effects.<br>
        Method we try to solve the induction equation by assuming the symmertic around phi(so phi derivatives is zero) and try to solve these in z variable at some fixed r value.The method used to solved is the 6th order finite difference for spatial derivatives and RK4 method for time evolution.
        Then I simulated the kinematic regime of both dynamo to observe behavior of magnetic fields.<br>
        The Solution we got for &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo are oscillatory in nature ,doesn't attain some dominant eigenmode,while &#945;-&#937; Dynamo attains specific dominant eigenmode even if we provide some alpha function only thing matters here,is Dynamo number D should be greater than some critical Dynamo number D<sub>c</sub>.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Introduction to your Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).
        </p>
        Studying the Alpha^2 dynamo and Alpha-omega dynamo models is motivated by the quest to understand the mechanisms responsible for generating and sustaining magnetic fields in astrophysical systems, particularly in stars and galaxies.
        Particularly in Alpha^2 Dynamo,provides a fundamental framework for understanding how magnetic fields are generated through the interaction of turbulent fluid motions and magnetic fields themselves.It explaining the generation of magnetic fields in stars and galaxies where turbulence is prevalent.
        Also the Alpha^2 dynamo model depends on the interplay between convection and differential rotation in astrophysical bodies.Studying this model allows scientists to better understand how these fluid motions contribute to the amplification and maintenance of magnetic fields.<br>
        In Alpha-Omega Dynamo,model extends the Alpha^2 dynamo by considering the role of differential rotation in generating magnetic fields.It is relevant for systems with a strong differential rotation, such as the Sun and rapidly rotating stars.The Alpha-omega dynamo model predicts the formation of a toroidal magnetic field component, which is aligned with the rotation axis of the astrophysical object.
        This prediction matches observations of magnetic fields in many stars and galaxies, providing insights into their origin.<br>
        In this MHD Project
I have to solve for Induction equation , where i solve  B<sub>r</sub> and B<sub> &#966; </sub> in z.(neglect the r derivatives in the induction equation)
Induction equations (for each component of mangetic field) are following
<div id="equation">
$$\frac{\partial B_r}{\partial t}=-\frac{V_r}{r}\frac{\partial }{\partial r}(r*B_r)+\frac{\partial }{\partial z}(V_z*B_r)-\frac{\partial }{\partial z}(\alpha*B_{\phi})+\eta_t(\frac{\partial }{\partial r}(\frac{\partial }{r \partial r}(r B_{\phi}))+\frac{\partial^2 B_r}{\partial z ^2})$$
</div>
$$\frac{\partial B_{\phi}}{\partial t}=-q\Omega B_r-\frac{\partial }{\partial r}(V_r*B_{\phi})+\frac{\partial }{\partial z}(V_z*B_{\phi})-\frac{\partial }{\partial z}(\alpha*B_r)+\eta_t(\frac{\partial }{\partial r}(\frac{\partial }{r \partial r}(r B_{\phi}))+\frac{\partial^2 B_{\phi}}{\partial z ^2})$$
I'm using the unitless equation which we findout in Assignment-3,
<div id="equation">
    $$\frac{\partial B_r'}{\partial t'}=-\frac{V_r'}{r'}\frac{\partial }{\partial r'}(r'*B_r')+\frac{\partial }{\partial z'}(V_z'*B_r')-\frac{\partial }{\partial z'}(\alpha'*B_{\phi}')+(\frac{\partial }{\partial r'}(\frac{\partial }{r' \partial r'}(r' B_{\phi}'))+\frac{\partial^2 B_r'}{\partial z'^2})$$
    </div>
    $$\frac{\partial B_{\phi}'}{\partial t'}=-q\Omega' B_r'-\frac{\partial }{\partial r'}(V_r'*B_{\phi}')+\frac{\partial }{\partial z'}(V_z'*B_{\phi}')-\frac{\partial }{\partial z}(\alpha'*B_r')+(\frac{\partial }{\partial r'}(\frac{\partial }{r' \partial r'}(r' B_{\phi}'))+\frac{\partial^2 B_{\phi}'}{\partial z'^2})$$
All terms with Magnetic field is in unit of B<sub>0</sub>(any unit based of seed field),distances are of units of h<sub>0</sub>, time is of the unit t<sub>0</sub>=h<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>/&#951;<sub>t</sub> and velocity term of the unit of h<sub>0</sub>/t<sub>0</sub>.

<section id="Computational Methods">
    <h2>Computational Methods</h2>
    <h3>Codes</h3>
    <p>From the computational point of view, here we have to solve partial differential equation in time and z variables.
    Usually all equation here, have only single time derivative term for each component in the LHS, while in RHS terms are the spatial derivatives of r and phi component of the magntic fields.<br>
    Now,due to this nature of the equation , i am using the 2D array having 0 index as r and 1 index as phi component of magntic field.
    For each spatial derivatives term (here in my case its only in z), i have defined functions for taking second deriavatives and first derivatives, with general input function, and functional variables.
    Since this general function, i had used this functions for both PDE in general.<br>
    Now for the Spatial derivative part, I have used the 6th Order finite difference method to find out the spatial derivatives.
    $$f_i'=\frac{-f_{i-3}+9f_{i-2}-45f_{i-1}+45f_{i+1}-9f_{i+2}+f_{i+3}}{60*dz}$$
    $$f_i''=\frac{+2f_{i-3}-27f_{i-2}+270f_{i-1}-490f_{i}+270f_{i+1}-27f_{i+2}+2f_{i+3}}{180*dz^2}$$
    Since this is 6th Order, we will have extra 3 terms at the each boundary to be fixed based of boundary condition.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now i use Boundary Condition to fixed value of function, i make the external 3 points as Ghost zone(at each boundary) which such that to make boundary point to be fixed(Moslty i use Anti-symmertric Ghost Zone and maked the Boundary values as Zero).<br>

    After this do, we will go for just time evolution of the all function RHS to equation where LHS is time derivatives.
    These time Evolution is done using the Fourth-Order Runge-Kutta method,which is an iterative method used to approximate solutions to initial value problems involving ODEs.Now here evolution equation in general is of the form,
    $$\frac{\partial \bar{B}}{\partial t}=f(\bar{B})$$
    Now using RK4 Time stepping to evolve in time(here dt is discrete time steping unit)
    $$K1=dt*f(\bar{B})$$
    $$K2=dt*f(\bar{B}+K1/2)$$
    $$K3=dt*f(\bar{B}+K2/2)$$
    $$K4=dt*f(\bar{B}+K3)$$
    Then the 'dt' evolution of B is 
    $$\bar{B}(t+dt)=B(t)+\frac{1}{6}(K1+2K2+3K3+K4)$$
    This step done at finite number of times(N) to get the time evolution of B at time, T=Ndt.
    </p>
    <h3>Plotting Methods</h3>
    I am plotting the r and phi component of B ,with some specific times.Now the problem here happens, when the ampilitude the some time is B very high in magnitude,
    so in effective small magnitude but essential plots are not Visible.
     In order to see all the graphs shape and its change happens in time,I divide all the B(z) function with its supermum(sup) of B(z) for all z in domain(in simpler term maximum ampiltude of the function for all z).<br>
     Now for Decay measurement part, mean value(in all z) of each magnetic field components value (which gives mean value of Net magnetic field) and then take square root.This function is calculated for all time uptil total stimlation time of T.
     <br>This is then plotted as log10(mean Net B)  as function  time(t) and we fit the curve for higher time interval in which the slope of the curve becomes constant.
    This value give Decay rate(&#947;) or Growth rate(Positive decay rate) of overall magnetic field.This gives clear idea, whether the Overall the dynamo is working or not (can be used to calculate the values of paramters at which the it would works).
    <h3>Method used to calculate the Critical Dynamo number and Critical maximum &#945;<sub>0</sub> Values for which Growth happens
    </h3>
    Here,i use as dummy variable D to run the 'D' or '&#945;<sub>0</sub>' values. Now i had made all above operations as function of D and &#945;<sub>0</sub>.(Where D=0 means &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo and else its &#945;-&#937; Dynamo effect)
    Now i can vary the D value in loop, which start running upto how much precision in each value it should have(this value should be the error for this calculation).Now we run this, starting with D=0 zero value for some d and run round with D increment with d, let's say d=5.
    Now that 5 added to D , then check whether &#947;>0, if yes then do to next round starting from previous D value and the make the d-> d/2, else then we go to next round without changing d and D will get added by d.
    This loop will continues till the decribed error value can have in critical value, greater than the d value going to next round. In this way the convergence happens at exponential rates, and we get the Critical value without running codes many times than that with fixed value variations.

    <h2>Task-3</h2>

Aim of this Task-3 is to find out the difference between the &#945;-&#937; Dynamo (Exactly same as I have done in Task-2) and &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo effect (where we include only the Alpha effect term in the r and Phi component equations).<br>

Now the equation consider for the task three is  (Only in z derivatives are consider and Velocity terms are taken as zero )<br>
$$\frac{\partial B_r '}{\partial t'}=-\frac{\partial (\alpha ' B_{\phi}')}{\partial z'}+\frac{\partial^2 B_r'}{\partial z ^{'2}}$$
$$\frac{\partial B_{\phi}'}{\partial t'}=-q\Omega ' B_{r} ' +\frac{\partial (\alpha ' B_{r}')}{\partial z'}+\frac{\partial^2 B_{\phi} '}{\partial z^{'2} }$$
Note:Here I neglecting &#945;<sup>2</sup> effect in &#945;-&#937; Dynamo effect and &#937; term will be zero for &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo. <br>
Now take the Dynamo number equation as
$$D=-\frac{q\Omega \alpha _0 h^3}{\eta _t^2}$$
which gives under the unitless equation becomes &#945; changes as &#945;'=&#945; t<sub>0</sub>/h<sub>0</sub>(where t<sub>0</sub>=h<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>/&#951;<sub>t</sub>) and &#937; changes as &#937;'=&#937;*h<sub>0
</sub><sup>2</sup>/&#951;<sub>t</sub> using this <br>
Now the equation consider for the &#945;-&#937; Dynamo is (in unitless form is)
$$\frac{\partial B_r '}{\partial t'}=-\frac{\partial (\alpha ' B_{\phi}')}{\partial z'}+\frac{\partial^2 B_r'}{\partial z ^{'2}}$$
$$\frac{\partial B_{\phi}'}{\partial t'}=\frac{D}{\alpha_0 '} B_{r} '+\frac{\partial^2 B_{\phi} '}{\partial z^{'2} }$$
And the Equation for &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo effect is
$$\frac{\partial B_r '}{\partial t'}=-\frac{\partial (\alpha ' B_{\phi}')}{\partial z'}+\frac{\partial^2 B_r'}{\partial z ^{'2}}$$
$$\frac{\partial B_{\phi}'}{\partial t'}=+\frac{\partial (\alpha ' B_{r}')}{\partial z'}+\frac{\partial^2 B_{\phi} '}{\partial z^{'2} }$$
Here, we use the &#945; functions as 
$$\alpha' =\alpha_0' sin(\pi z)$$
And
$$\alpha' =\alpha_0'* z$$

        <h2>Simulation Results</h2>
        <h3>&#945;-&#937; Dynamo</h3>
        Here, for this simulation I am using the alpha function as both z as well as sin(pi*z).<br>
        Intially we will findout the Critical Dynamo number for both alpha functions from the same code in Task-2, 
        $$|D_c|=12.51953125 (\,for\,\alpha=z)$$
        $$|D_c|=12.51953125 (\,for\,\alpha=10z)$$
        $$|D_c|=8.06640625  (\,for\,\alpha=sin(\pi z))$$
        $$|D_c|=8.06640625  (\,for\,\alpha=10sin(\pi z))$$
        Note:Both the outputs for different values are done done for a long time(assume 50-130 t<sub>0</sub> as infinite time) and here i am providing a seed field of sin(pi*z) for phi component and zero for r component. Also with change in seed doesn't matter if we wait for a long time to evloution of equation.
        All the outputs will be in kinematic region after long time evloution.<br>
        <h4>Look at the &#945;-&#937; Dynamo with D &lt D<sub>c</sub></h4>
        Lets take D=(-5)
        <h5>&#945;=(z)</h5>

        </div>
        Here I can see from 3 plot, the net magnetic divided by maximum amilitude of net magnetic field from this we could see the evolution of shape of function in time,these all curve have have shape and superimpose to one figure, this gives that the solution under this condition is decaying for all values of z.<br>
        Similar results also get if we change the &#945;<div class=""></div>

        Now lets look at the output magnetic field we get for &#945;-&#937; Dynamo with different Alpha function(Amplitude of Alpha functions doesn't matter, only shape does matter).<br>
        Now from the results, i can see that above the Critical dynamo number range, increase in Amplitude of Alpha functions doesn't change growth rate but the overall shape and function form doesn't change within this speculated time.<br>
        Now in theory if the wait for infinite time, the we can say that &#945;-&#937; Dynamo doesn't depends on the amplitude of Alpha effect and its functional form.<br>
        From this results, i can conclude in absolute sense that &#945;-&#937; Dynamo will have same growth rate for same alpha functional not affected by ampilitude alpha function but having the different functional form of same Alpha magmitude will have different growth rate.(This makes sense, given that we have done finite evolution only(not actually infinite time)).<br>
        
        <h3>&#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo</h3>
        Here we do simulation with different alpha functional as well as the ampilitude for which the &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo has to work.<br>

        From the fitted plot-4, the growth rate equals = 0.358349989<br>
        
        These results give us an hint that there should exist come miniumum ampilitude for different alpha functional in order for growth of &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo to happen.<br>
        Something like critical Dynamo number required for &#945;-&#937; Dynamo, here &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo requires a critical &#945;<sub>c</sub> ampilitude. (Note:this &#945;<sub>c</sub> maybe depends on the &#945; functional used)<br>
        Now i will calculate this critical &#945;<sub>c</sub> ampilitude value for each &#945;(z) functionals.
        <h3>Critical &#945;<sub>c</sub> ampilitude</h3>
        $$\alpha_c=8.033203125 \,(for\, (z) \,)$$
        $$\alpha_c=5.015625 \,(for\, (sin(\pi z)) \,)$$
        From the growth rate above, we can see that when &#945; &gt &#945;<sub>c</sub>,then the growth rate goes as rapidly more steadliy than the &#945;-&#937; Dynamo.
        <h2>Now Analysis of the solution to &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo</h2>
        From the two example cases, Final solution (Net Magnetic field) depends on the function of alpha.Unlike in the case &#945;-&#937; Dynamo,where whatever the D and &#945; after a long time we get the same output Net magnetic field(Dominate Eigenmode).
        We can see that the Net or total magnetic field strength (amplitude)is increases without change in the shape of overall magnetic field in all time steps.This is Net magnetic field dominate mode
        ,but when we look at the each components itself. Its not becoming a some normal fixed function time the exponential term, this indiuvidual terms oscillates between each other in time.
        <br> Let's look at each component reading for different time steps.
        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/aaplots1.png" alt="Image 1">
        <img src="images/aaplots2.png" alt="Image 2">
        <img src="images/aaplots3.png" alt="Image 3">
        <img src="images/aaplots4.png" alt="Image 4">
        </div>
        From these graphs and plots we could see that the shap of B<sub>r</sub> and B<sub>&#966;</sub> terms are oscillating there shapes and they comes to one shape after around approximate 60 (60 t<sub>0</sub>) it will comw back to same state and it will contiues.In this same time its ampilitude get exponetially growing.
        And from the curve of the Net Magnetic which show as consistent shape for fixed Alpha function and its is exponetially growing without any oscillation or change in shape.
        Thus overall &#945;-&#937; Dynamo and &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo both amplifies the seed magnetic field under the condition where some constraints are above some critical value(which I calculated for 2 examples).
        This method and each individual components evoultion with time is different in both dynamos, even the Net Magnetic field eigenmode shapes also changes with parameter, which is controlling the dynamo.
       <h2>Difference between &#945;-&#937; Dynamo and &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo</h2>
       <h3>&#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Utilizes the &#945;-effect, where differential rotation generates a mean magnetic field from an initially weak seed field</li>
        <li>Requires helical turbulence to generate the &#945;-effect, often associated with the twisting of fluid motions, convection, shear flows, or the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in astrophysical contexts</li>
        <li>Operates effectively in systems where there is significant turbulence and differential rotation, example such as in the Sun's convective zone</li>
        <li>&#945;<sup>2</sup> dynamo relies primarily on turbulent motions to generate magnetic fields</li>
        <li>Limitation to explain the maintenance of large-scale magnetic fields over long periods without additional mechanisms, as turbulence tends to act to disperse magnetic fields rather than concentrate them.</li>
        <li>The solution to &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo Oscillatory in nature.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>&#945;-&#937; Dynamo</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Combines the &#945;-effect with the &#937;-effect, where differential rotation acts on a pre-existing magnetic field to regenerate and amplify it</li>
        <li>Requires both differential rotation and a pre-existing magnetic field.The differential rotation provides the twisting necessary to amplify the field, while the pre-existing field serves as the seed for amplification.</li>
        <li>Provides a mechanism for maintaining and amplifying large-scale magnetic fields over long periods.</li>
        <li>Often observed in astrophysical bodies with well-defined differential rotation and magnetic fields, like stars and galaxies.
            Example, as observed in the Sun's tachocline, where the transition between the radiative and convective zones leads to a significant shear layer that can amplify magnetic fields</li>
        <li>The solution to &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo are steadily growing in nature</li>
        <li>Solution doesn't depends on &#945; effect value if we wait for long time to evolve the function</li>
        <li>Solutions have same kind of spatial variance for all alphas and only depends on whether D greater than or less than D<sub>c</sub>(which determines decay or growth)</li>
       </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        Through our exhaustive examination of galactic mean-field dynamos, we have diligently scrutinized and extracted significant insights from the simulations and findings garnered. 
        Throughout our analysis, numerous pivotal observations have surfaced, unveiling the nuanced dynamics governing cosmic magnetic fields within galactic structures. These observations have not only deepened our understanding of the intricate interplay between magnetic fields and galactic processes but also provided valuable implications for broader astrophysical phenomena.
        <ul>
            <li>From my Analysis,I could see that for both &#945;-&#937; Dynamo and &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo require some kind of critical parameter values to be need for the Dynamo to grow,else it would decay as diffusion equation(of Task-1) over certain time.
                The former effect need to satisfy the Dynamo Number (D) to greater than Critcal Dynamo Number(D<sub>c</sub>),which intern depends on the spatial distribution of &#945; .</li>
            <li>The solution to &#945;-&#937; Dynamo and &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo doesn't depends on seed field under the kinematic regime </li>
            <li>Both Dynamo Net magnetic field under kinematic regime</li>
            <li>Numerical Solutions to one dimensional(in z) &#945;<sup>2</sup> Dynamo reveals oscillatory solution for each components</li>
            <li>These oscillation are realtively insensitive to our choice of Alpha's spatial distribution (As per, we had analyzed two examples of Alpha).</li>

            <li>Future extensions can be made study about the oscillation frequency dependance of the mean helicity extremums and boundary of the regions and also Non-linear effects of Alpha and how its affects the Oscillations.</li>
           <li>Modeling Complexity,Modeling the &#945;<sup>2</sup> dynamo primarily involves simulating turbulent flows and their interaction with magnetic fields, which can be computationally intensive but less complex than the Alpha-Omega dynamo.
            The Alpha-Omega dynamo requires accurate modeling of both turbulent motions and differential rotation, making it more computationally challenging and requiring sophisticated numerical techniques for precise measurement without loosing resolution.</li>
        </ul>

        In conclusion, our comprehensive simulations of the &#945;<sup>2</sup> and Alpha-Omega dynamos have provided invaluable insights into the generation and amplification of magnetic fields within astrophysical systems. Through meticulous observation and analysis, we have gained a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics governing cosmic magnetism within galactic structures.

<br>The simulations of the &#945;<sup>2</sup> dynamo have elucidated the crucial role of turbulence in initiating and sustaining magnetic field generation. However, we have also noted limitations regarding the maintenance of large-scale magnetic fields over extended periods, highlighting the challenges posed by turbulence in concentrating magnetic energy.<br>

Similarly, our investigations into the Alpha-Omega dynamo have underscored the significance of differential rotation in amplifying pre-existing magnetic fields. While these simulations have shed light on the mechanisms driving magnetic field evolution, they have also revealed constraints related to the availability of pre-existing magnetic fields and the complexity of accurately modeling turbulent and rotational dynamics.<br>

Overall, our simulations have deepened our understanding of the interplay between magnetic fields and galactic processes, offering valuable insights into the broader astrophysical phenomena shaping our universe. Moving forward, further refinement of our models and continued observational studies will be essential for advancing our understanding of galactic mean-field dynamos and their role in shaping the cosmos.
